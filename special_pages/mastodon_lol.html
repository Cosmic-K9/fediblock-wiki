<h1>[ Special ] mastodon.lol</h1>
<p>mastodon.lol, according to it's “About” page as of February 10, is “A Mastodon server friendly towards anti-fascists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, hackers, and the like.”</p>
<h2>Instance shutdown</h2>
<p>On February 9th, 2023 at 12:20pm mastodon.lol timezone, &nbsp;the lead administrator and operator of <a href="https://mastodon.lol/">mastodon.lol</a> sent a message out on their account. This message informed their users that on May 9, 2023 that the mastodon.lol instance would be shutting down.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…Mastodon.lol will shut down on May 9, 2023, 3 months from today…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason <a href="https://mastodon.lol/@nathan/">@nathan@mastodon.lol</a> provided is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…I'm not doing this anymore. It's not worth it. Personal attacks calling me of all people a Nazi, a TERF, an antisemite...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is possibly in relation to a previous message they sent out on the same account, informing their users that they would not be banning users for playing <a href="https://www.hogwartslegacy.com"><i>Hogwarts Legacy</i></a>, a game based on the books written by writer, author and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/10/873472683/harry-potters-magic-fades-when-his-creator-tweets">infamous transgender-exclusionary feminist</a> (TERF) J.K. Rowling.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We're not banning people for buying a video game. Express your displeasure to them if you so wish, but that alone doesn't require our attention.</p>
  <p>Related, please don't post spoilers just to spite people. You can justify it to yourself however you like, but you're shouting into a crowd here. Not every HP fan knows J.K. Rowling is a piece of shit, and ruining the days of random bystanders ain't the way to go.</p>
  <p>It *will* cause problems for myself and .lol in general if it continues. Thanks."</p>

<p>Many of the comments under this message are users of the instance, upset that @nathan was feigning ignorance, and by advocating for a more civil way of protesting a game, the instance operator was speaking from a place of privilege.</p>
<h2>Operator conduct</h2>
<p>On Nov 25, 2022 at 10:56 rage.love time, a user by the name of <a href="https://rage.love/@noyovo">@noyovo@rage.love</a> wrote a message to the Fediverse stating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>mastodon.lol meta</p>
  <p>"Dude's banning "People who are sympathetic to left-wing authoritarian regimes" but keeping sympathizers of "centrist" &amp; right-wing authoritarian regimes lmao. Not to mention all kinds of racists but that's a given. Contradictions heightening"</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The second message in the thread reads as following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>context re: mastodon.lol meta</p>
  <p>Quoted his post [1] directly to avoid misinterpetation. Pretty sure (but just guessing) he said it because of the backlash to him choosing to suspend Codepink [2] — which is certainly an annoying &amp; bad "left" org, but again a lot of those he seems happy to let stay aren't any better!!</p>

<p>These messages along lead The #FEDIBLOCK Wiki to believe that there was “bad blood” between the users of rage.love and the operator of mastodon.lol based purely on politics alone. It wasn't until Feb 09, 2023 at 14:25 rage.love time that the recommendation for a #fediblock of mastodon.lol came from the same user.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>instance block</p>
  <p>#FediBlock mastodon.lol - the admin is dying on the hill of…wait for it…gamers rights.</p>
  <p>No really, it's over the harry potter shit [1]. He's actually gonna shut down the instance [2] &amp; is telling people calling him out to kill themselves, soooo yeah.</p>
  <p>This is part of a pattern of shitty behavior, see the posts immediately above this one &amp; also the time he made a rule against asking for money then acted like he didn't once people noticed.</p>
  <p>Finally if you're interested in making things like this happen less often, let's talk about the intense white radlib energy that instance *always* gave off collectively &amp; be a little more critical of the conditions that produced the behavior beyond just writing him off as another 'bad actor'.</p>

<p>A follow-up to a reply on this message by <a href="https://social.coop/@gcoleman">@gcoleman@social.coop</a> shows a screenshot of @nathan allegedly telling critics of the instance operator to commit suicide. The #FEDIBLOCK Wiki reached out to @gcoleman, but due to the messages already being deleted before we could ask for links to them, they were not able to provide them.</p>

<p>If you or anyone you know can provide archived links of these message to The #FEDIBLOCK Wiki, please reach out to us: research@thefediblock.wiki</p>
<h2>Final statements</h2>
<p>We at The #FEDIBLOCK Wiki would like to commend @nathan@mastodon.lol for running their instance as well as they have for as long as they have. It's never easy to appease to both sides of an argument. No matter what, the other side will feel betrayed. At the end of the day, it's about making decisions that will benefit the instance as a whole.</p>
<p>However, if the screenshot of @nathan instructing their critics to commit suicide is real, we do have to step up and condemn this behaviour. While it is understandable that they were under immense stress, this does not excuse one from making such statements.</p>
<p>Since @nathan does appear to be offline for the foreseeable future, it is difficult to tell if we will hear anymore from them in regards to this situation. Nathan, we would like to hear your side of the story, so feel free to DM or email us.</p>

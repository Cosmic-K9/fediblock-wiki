  <p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>This wiki should not be used as a definitive list of federated services ("instances") to defederate from.</strong></mark><br>Administrators of instances viewing this wiki should consider the things listed on this wiki, and whether the instance is deserving of a defederation before doing so.</p>
  <p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>We do not tolerate the harassment of other instances into defederating from another, risking defederation of the other instances if they don't.</strong></mark><br>If an instance is caught doing this, they have a high probability of showing up here. This is highly-irresponsible behaviour and only serves to destroy the concept of federation in the first place. The choice to defederate from an instance lies squarely with the administrators and operators of any given instance.</p>
